# Home Mortgage Market Analysis Using Spark on Google Cloud

## Project Description
This project involves an exploration of the Home Mortgage Market using Spark on Google Cloud. The aim was to analyze a large dataset of home mortgage applications to draw insights about the applicant's profiles, loan characteristics, and the possible influences on loan amounts. The ultimate goal was to build a predictive model for determining loan amounts based on the applicant's profile and loan characteristics.

## Technologies Used
- Apache Spark
- Google Cloud Dataproc
- PySpark

## Overview of the Process
1. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, duplicates, and outliers using PySpark.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying correlations between different variables, visualizing distributions of variables, and much more.
3. Predictive Modeling: Preparing the data for machine learning, selecting relevant features, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Key Findings
- A direct correlation exists between an applicant's income and their borrowing capacity.
- Economic conditions, lending policies, and lending agencies play a role in influencing loan amounts.
- Factors such as gender, race, and ethnicity may not significantly influence loan decisions.

## Challenges
Handling the large size of the dataset was the main challenge in this project. However, with the power of Spark and Google Cloud Dataproc, this was effectively managed.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrated the power and efficiency of using Spark and Google Cloud Dataproc for big data projects, successfully analyzing a large dataset of home mortgage applications and building a predictive model for loan amounts.
